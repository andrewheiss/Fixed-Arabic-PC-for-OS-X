# Fixed Arabic - PC keyboard layout for OS X

For some reason, the "Arabic - PC" keyboard layout in Mac OS X 10.4 and above is missing the letter *thal* ( ذ ) and the diacritic *shadda* ( ّ ). On standard Arabic PC keyboard layouts these are assigned to the tilde key to the left of the number 1, but OS X replaced the key with a comma. 

Install this keyboard layout to restore the missing *thal* and *shadda*.

## Installation

1. Copy both `Arabic-good.keylayout` and `Arabic-good.icns` to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts` or `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`
2. Go to System Preferences > Language & Text > Input Sources.
3. At the bottom of the list of keyboard layouts you should see one titled "العربي".
4. Select it and type away!
